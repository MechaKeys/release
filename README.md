# MechaKeys Update Repository
The public release repository for builds of MechaKeys.

Binary installers for Windows (64-bit), macOS, and Linux (tar.gz) will be published in this repository.

## OS Support

MechaKeys is currently tested on Windows 10 and 11, 64-bit.

MechaKeys is supported on macOS 10.14 and above.

MechaKeys is tested on Arch Linux, and Arch-based distributions like Endeavour are also tested.


## Autoupdate Compatibility
Windows users are able to automatically download and install updates without manual intervention.

macOS users cannot automatically update, and must download and install the latest build manually.

Linux-based users will automatically download the latest tar.gz archive of the build.

## Versions
Versions may be presented in different formats.

A `major.minor.patch` system is used to track version upgrades, though you will rarely see changes to the major version.

In the app settings, you will see a short string of numbers and letters. **This is the preferred version type to send to Robolab developers.**
